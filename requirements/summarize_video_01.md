# Summarizing a Video Using a Local Mistral Model

This document outlines the steps to summarize a video by extracting audio, transcribing it to text, and then summarizing the text using a local Mistral model.

## Steps

### 1. Extract Audio from Video

Use a library like `moviepy` or `ffmpeg` to extract the audio track from the video file.

```python
import moviepy.editor as mp

# Load the video file
video = mp.VideoFileClip("path/to/video.mp4")

# Extract audio and save it as a .wav file
video.audio.write_audiofile("extracted_audio.wav")
```

### 2. Transcribe Audio to Text

Utilize a speech-to-text library or model to convert the audio into text. Libraries like `Whisper`, `Vosk`, or `DeepSpeech` can be used.

```python
# Option 1: Using Whisper
import whisper

# Load the Whisper model
model = whisper.load_model("base")  # You can choose different sizes: tiny, base, small, medium, large

# Transcribe the audio file
result = model.transcribe("extracted_audio.wav")
text = result['text']

# Option 2: Using Vosk
from vosk import Model, KaldiRecognizer
import wave

# Load the Vosk model
model = Model("path/to/vosk/model")
wf = wave.open("extracted_audio.wav", "rb")
rec = KaldiRecognizer(model, wf.getframerate())

# Read the audio file and transcribe
while True:
    data = wf.readframes(4000)
    if len(data) == 0:
        break
    if rec.AcceptWaveform(data):
        result = rec.Result()
    else:
        result = rec.PartialResult()

text = result  # Final transcription result

# Option 3: Using DeepSpeech
import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import wave

# Load the DeepSpeech model
model = deepspeech.Model("path/to/deepspeech/model.pbmm")

# Read the audio file
wf = wave.open("extracted_audio.wav", "rb")
frames = wf.getnframes()
buffer = wf.readframes(frames)
audio = np.frombuffer(buffer, dtype=np.int16)

# Transcribe the audio
text = model.stt(audio)
```

### 3. Summarize the Text

Load the Mistral model and pass the transcribed text to it for summarization.

```python
from mistralai import Mistral  # Updated import

# Load your mistralai model
model = mistralai.load("path/to/mistral/model")  # Updated model loading

# Summarize the transcribed text
summary = model.summarize(text)  # Hypothetical summarize method

# Print the summary
print(summary)
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`moviepy`, `whisper`, `vosk`, `deepspeech`, etc.).
- The Mistral model's loading and summarization methods may vary based on the specific implementation you are using.
- Adjust the paths and methods according to your local setup and the specific Mistral model you are using.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively summarize a video using a local Mistral model. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
